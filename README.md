# inventory-application
Fake Whisky store/catalogue in which you can interact with products. A practice CRUD app (create, read, update and delete). 
Check it out on Heroku [here](https://young-eyrie-64675.herokuapp.com/). The free tier of heroku can take 5-15s to load the site the first time.

## Description
This site interacts with a mongoDB database to store info on whisky, their distiller and their category.
You can view all whiskies with various sort options or filter by a category or distillery.
Whiskies, categories and distilleries can be edited or deleted.
I have not hosted this site on my Linode server as I want to focus on developing sites right now, not deploying them.
